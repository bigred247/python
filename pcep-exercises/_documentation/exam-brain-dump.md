`pop()` 
is an inbuilt function in Python that removes and returns last value from the list or the given index value.

`remove` 
The remove() method removes the first matching element (which is passed as an argument) from the list.

`txt.index("welcome")` 
The index() method finds the first occurrence of the specified value `welcome`.

`find`
The index() method is almost the same as the find() method, the only difference is that the find() method returns -1 if the value is not found
fruits.

`count`
("cherry")` fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
x = fruits.count("cherry")
Return the number of times the value "cherry" appears in the fruits list: so 1 in this case

`!=`
This means NOT EQUAL to. So 55 != 99 would return `True`
e.g. `print("mouse" != "mouse")` would return `False` because mouse is equal to mouse.
