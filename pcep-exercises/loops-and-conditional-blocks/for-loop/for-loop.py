for letter in 'hello!':
    print('Current letter:', letter)

# the word "letter" after the `for` loop is a `control variable`.
# the `in` statement instructs Python to scan all of the characters in the string `hello!`
# so the for loop iterates through each character in the string until complete

# this outputs below:

""" 
Current letter: h
Current letter: e
Current letter: l
Current letter: l
Current letter: o
Current letter: ! 
"""
